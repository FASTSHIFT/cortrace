# Cortrace

[简体中文](README.md) | **English**

**Cortrace** turns raw ARM CoreSight ETM/DWT/ITM trace bytes into a function-level
[Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev) timeline: call stacks, RTOS thread lanes and (NuttX)
software notes fused with the hardware trace on one time axis. It decodes with the official
ARM/Linaro reference decoder [OpenCSD](https://github.com/Linaro/OpenCSD) and ships the PC-side
tools for the FPGA parallel-trace capture appliance.

> Design philosophy and roadmap live in [`docs/00-architecture.md`](docs/00-architecture.md).

## Install (Ubuntu 22.04 amd64)

Download `cortrace_<version>_amd64.deb` from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FASTSHIFT/cortrace/releases):

```sh
sudo apt install ./cortrace_*_amd64.deb      # pulls in python3 and binutils-arm-none-eabi
cortrace --help
```

No clone is needed and no privileges either (`cortrace-grab` runs without root or setcap on
Linux >= 5.7).

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `cortrace capture` | grab a parallel trace from the FPGA and decode it to Perfetto (`--fuse` also fuses the NuttX notes) |
| `cortrace serve` | in ui.perfetto.dev choose *Record new trace -> Linux -> WebSocket 127.0.0.1:8037* and press **Start**: the capture runs and the result comes back in the same page |
| `cortrace decode` | run `cortrace-decode` (ETM/DWT/ITM -> Perfetto) directly, arguments passed through |
| `cortrace fuse` | one raw capture -> hardware trace + NuttX notes fused on one time axis |
| `cortrace tcbmap` / `align` | read the live thread-name map / fit the clock offset between hardware and notes |
| `cortrace fpga ctrl\|net\|health` | CSR control, link discovery and health readout of the capture appliance |
| `cortrace open` | open a trace file in ui.perfetto.dev |

**The output directory is always explicit**: `--out-dir DIR` or `export CORTRACE_OUT_DIR=DIR`. A
capture streams ~75 MB/s and the decoded files are ~5x the raw size (about 450 MB per second of
trace), so cortrace never picks a location for you; it estimates the space needed before writing
anything and stops if the disk cannot hold it, and captures over 5 s need `--allow-long`. cortrace
never deletes files on its own.

```sh
export CORTRACE_OUT_DIR=~/traces
cortrace capture --iface enx0123 --elf fw.elf --secs 1 --width 4 --open
cortrace serve   --iface enx0123 --elf fw.elf          # then press Start in the web page
```

> cortrace does not enable ETM/DWT/ITM on the target: configure them with your debugger first and
> keep it attached. Fusing with NuttX's nxtrace needs pynuttx (the pip package, or `--pynuttx DIR` /
> `$PYNUTTX` pointing at its sources).

**The full walkthrough (standalone, hardware + software fusion, click-to-capture in the browser,
troubleshooting) is in [`docs/04-user-guide.md`](docs/04-user-guide.md)** (written in Chinese).

## Why

The trimmed-down ETMv4 decoders other projects use go wrong when capture
quality is marginal: on a corrupt byte they keep walking with a stale PC,
fabricating up to ~4.6x the real instruction count and hundreds of phantom
function re-entries. OpenCSD handles the same stream correctly and honestly
marks undecodable regions instead of inventing program flow. Cortrace
outsources the hardest part -- ETM decode -- to OpenCSD and owns only the
deterministic layer above it: call-stack reconstruction, time-base alignment,
and Perfetto export.

The prototype produced a call graph that matches the ELF **edge-for-edge
(0 mismatch)**, with nesting balanced. The current `cortrace-decode` CLI runs
the full offline pipeline (real OpenCSD library -> call-stack machine) and
reproduces that result on a CoreMark slice: **11/11 call edges against the ELF,
0 mismatch, begin/end balanced, 14 SysTick exceptions rendered**.

## Build from source

Requires CMake >= 3.16, a C++17 compiler, and optionally `libopencsd-dev` for
the decoder adapter. The core library + tests build without OpenCSD; with
OpenCSD present it additionally produces the `cortrace-decode` CLI.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Build the .deb yourself (inside an ubuntu:22.04 container so the runtime dependencies match that
release; the version comes from the latest `vX.Y.Z` tag):

```sh
scripts/build-deb.sh dist                       # produces dist/cortrace_<version>_amd64.deb
scripts/smoke-deb.sh dist/cortrace_*.deb        # clean container + ordinary user smoke test
```

Pushing a `v*` tag makes CI build the deb, smoke-test it and attach it to the GitHub release.

### Versioning

The single source is the `VERSION` file at the repository root (the first release is `1.0.0`),
a subset of [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with an optional
`aN`/`bN`/`rcN` (pre-release), `.postN` or `.devN` suffix, e.g. `1.0.0`, `1.0.0a1`, `1.0.0rc1`,
`1.0.0.post1`, `1.0.0.dev3`.

| Build | `cortrace version` / `cortrace-decode --version` |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| HEAD is exactly the `v<VERSION>` tag (a release) | `1.0.0` |
| any other commit (a development build) | `1.0.0+git<commits>.<hash>` |
| running an unbuilt source tree | `1.0.0+dev` |

The deb uses the Debian spelling so `apt` orders versions like PEP 440 does: `1.0.0a1` becomes
`1.0.0~a1` (sorts before `1.0.0`), `1.0.0.post1` becomes `1.0.0+post1`. To release: edit
`VERSION`, commit, `git tag v<VERSION>`, push. CI checks that the tag matches `VERSION`, and
`a`/`b`/`rc`/`dev` tags are marked as pre-releases on the GitHub release.

## Offline decode (cortrace-decode)

Run the full pipeline on a deframed ETMv4 byte stream and report quality
metrics (balance, call edges). `mem.bin` is a flat image of the ELF and
`mem_base` is its lowest LMA (`08000000` on the STM32H743, typically).

```sh
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary fw.elf mem.bin      # flat image
arm-none-eabi-nm fw.elf > syms.nm                   # symbol table
build/cortrace-decode capture.etm.bin mem.bin 08000000 syms.nm --edges edges.tsv
```

Criteria: `begins == ends` (balanced), and every edge in `edges.tsv`
corresponds to a real `bl` in the ELF (0 mismatch).

## Coverage

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON
cmake --build build --target coverage   # runs tests + gcovr, fails below the gate
```

Set the gate threshold with `-DCORTRACE_MIN_COVERAGE=<percent>` (default 90).
The HTML report lands in `build/coverage-html/`.

## Formatting

WebKit-based clang-format (see `.clang-format`).

```sh
scripts/format.sh          # C/C++ format in place (clang-format)
scripts/format.sh --check  # CI mode: fail on any diff
```

The Python package (`python/cortrace`) uses black + pylint (see `pyproject.toml`, `.pylintrc`):

```sh
scripts/format-py.sh          # black format in place
scripts/format-py.sh --check  # CI mode: black --check + pylint
python -m pytest python/tests --cov --cov-fail-under=90   # tests + coverage gate (90%)
```

## Git hooks

Enforce the format check on every commit:

```sh
scripts/install-hooks.sh   # sets core.hooksPath = .githooks
```

The `pre-commit` hook **blocks the commit** whenever any staged C/C++ source
does not conform to `.clang-format`, or any staged Python fails black/pylint. The `commit-msg` hook
requires subjects of the form `type(scope): description`; only `docs` may omit the scope.
